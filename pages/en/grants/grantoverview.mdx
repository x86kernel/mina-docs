# Grants & Programs

Apply for grants and programs in the Mina ecosystem

Mina has a dedicated global community of talented individuals working on the protocol while enhancing the ecosystem. Mina Foundation offers the following programs to promote growth of the Mina ecosystem, and actively creating more programs.

### Mina zkApps Builders Program

Mina’s zkApps Builders Program is a 12-week, online program to support developers who are building zkApp-related projects.

The goal of the program is to provide direct access to the O(1) Labs team to support developers as they build their zkApp project and for O(1) Labs to gather feedback for improving <DocLink copy="SnarkyJS" url="/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference" /> and <DocLink copy="zkApps" url="/zkapps" />. You can read more about the projects that came out of the [Winter 2022 Cohort here](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/zkapps-builders-program-spring-2022-wrapup).

To sign up for the 2022 Summer zkApps Builders Program, please [apply here](https://share.hsforms.com/1KUeCPxJzQC6PIZ-LLdZe1g4xuul).

### Quarterly Grants Program

The Mina Foundation deeply values each contribution and has made it a priority to reward those individuals whose work keeps the protocol decentralized and vibrant by offering a quarterly community grants program. 

In the past, grants have been awarded to projects ranging from from technical tools and scripts to non-technical community contributions like content, events, and translations. We encourage all contributors and developers in Mina’s ecosystem to apply for a retroactive grant.

Sign up for [our newsletter here](https://share.hsforms.com/1olz9N8_zTHW-RKQus2o3Kw4xuul) to stay updated on community grants, and how to get involved!

### Mina Foundation Delegation Program

Mina Foundation is committed to decentralizing the governance of the Mina protocol. In order to delegate its voting power, Mina Foundation and its affiliate O(1) Labs delegate its tokens to community members through the Foundation Delegation Program.
