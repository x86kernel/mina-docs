# How to write a zkApp

A zkApp consists of a smart contract and a UI to interact with it. First, we’ll install the zkApp CLI and write a smart contract.

## Write a smart contract

Your smart contract will be written using <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/zkapp-cli/">CLI</a>.

zkApp CLI makes it easy to follow recommended best practices by providing project scaffolding including dependencies such as SnarkyJS, a test framework (Jest), code auto-formatting (Prettier), linting (ES Lint), & more.

### Install zkApp CLI

#### Dependencies:

- NodeJS 16+ (or 14 using `node --experimental-wasm-threads`)
- NPM 6+
- Git 2+

<Alert kind="tip">

If you have an older version installed, we suggest installing a newer version using the package manager for your system: <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> (Mac), <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a> (Windows), or apt/yum/etc (Linux). On Linux, you may need to install a recent NodeJS version via NodeSource (<a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall">deb</a> or <a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#rpminstall">rpm</a>), as recommended by the NodeJS Project.

</Alert>

### Start a Project

Now that you have zkApp CLI installed, you can start with an example or start your own project.

#### Option A: Start with an example (recommended)

Examples are based on the standard project structure, but with additional files in the `/src` directory as the only difference.

1. **Install:** Run `zkApp example sudoku`. This creates a new project and includes the example files (i.e. the smart contract) inside the project’s `src/` directory. Type `ls` & hit enter to see the files that were created or open the directory in a code editor such as VS Code.
2. **Run tests:** Run `npm run test`. Tests are written using <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. After running this command, you should see all tests pass. You can also run `npm run testw` to run tests in watch mode, so it will automatically re-run tests when saving changes to your code.
3. **Build the example:** Run `npm run build`. This will compile your TypeScript into JavaScript inside the project’s `/build` directory.
4. **Deploy example on Testnet:** (Coming soon.)

You can view a list of <a href="https://github.com/o1-labs/zkApp-cli/tree/main/examples/">all available examples here</a>.

#### Option B: Start your own project

1. **Install:** Run `zkApp project <myproj>`. Type `ls` and hit enter to see the newly created project structure.
2. **Run tests:** Run `npm run test`. Tests are written using <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. After running this command, you should see all tests pass. You can also run `npm run testw` to run tests in watch mode, so it will automatically re-run tests when saving changes to your code.
3. **Build:** Run `npm run build`. This will compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript inside the project’s `/build`.
4. **Deploy to Testnet:** (Coming soon.)
5. **Deploy to Mainnet:** (Coming soon.)

### Writing your smart contract’s custom logic

The goal of this section is to explain the concepts that you will need to understand to write a zero-knowledge-based smart contract.

If you haven’t yet read the <DocLink copy="how zkApps work" url="/zkapps/how-zkapps-work" /> section, please read it first so that this section makes sense.

##### SnarkyJS

zkApps are written in TypeScript using SnarkyJS. SnarkyJS is a TypeScript library for writing smart contracts based on zero-knowledge proofs for the Mina Protocol. It is included automatically when creating a new project using the zkApp CLI.

To view the full SnarkyJS reference, please see <DocLink copy="here" url="/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

##### Concepts

Field elements are the basic unit of data in zero-knowledge proof programming. Each field element can store a number up to almost 256 bits in size. You can think of it as a uint256 in Solidity.

<Alert kind="note">

For the cryptography inclined, the exact max value that a field can store is: 28,948,022,309,329,048,855,892,746,252,171,976,963,363,056,481,941,560,715,954,676,764,349,967,630,336

</Alert>

For example, in typical programming, you might use:

`const sum = 1 + 3`.

In SnarkyJS, you would write this as:

`const sum = new Field(1).add(new Field(3))`

This can be simplified as:

`const sum = new Field(1).add(3)`

Note that the 3 is auto-promoted to a field type to make this cleaner.

##### Primitive data types

A couple common data types you may use are:

```
new Bool();     // accepts true or false
new Field();    // accepts an integer, or a numeric string if you want to represent a number greater than JavaScript can represent but within the max value that a field can store.
```

<Alert kind="info">

Support for strings within SnarkyJS will be available soon.

</Alert>

##### Conditionals

Traditional conditional statements are not yet supported by SnarkyJS:

```ts
// this will NOT work
if (foo) {
  x.assertEquals(y);
}
```

Instead, use SnarkyJS’ built-in `Circuit.if()` method.

const x = Circuit.if(new Bool(foo)).then(a).else(b);

##### Functions

Functions work as you would expect in TypeScript. For example:

```ts
function addOneAndDouble(x: Field): Field {
  return x.add(1).mul(2);
}
```

##### Common methods

Some common methods you will use often are:

```ts
let x = new Field(4); // x = 4
x = x.add(3); // x = 7
x = x.sub(1); // x = 6
x = x.mul(3); // x = 18
x = x.div(2); // x = 9
x = x.square(); // x = 81
x = x.sqrt(); // x = 9
```

For a full list, see the <DocLink copy="SnarkyJS reference" url="/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

##### Smart Contract

Let’s put this all together and create a basic smart contract. The smart contract is where you define your custom logic.

When writing a smart contract, you describe both your custom logic (to be used by the prover) and your assertions (to be used by the verifier) that will prove a given zero-knowledge proof is valid.

In the above example, the computation is `x.mul(x).mul(x)`, the assertion is x3.assertEquals(result), and `expected` is a public input. We’ll discuss these more in a bit.

Notice that our class extends `SmartContract`. However, your class can contain various other helper methods if desired.

When you build your smart contract (`npm run build`), a file called `smart_contract.js` will be created, which will contain both the **prover function** and the **verifier function** for your circuit.

##### Private Inputs & Public Inputs

**Private inputs** and **public inputs** are data required by either the prover function or verifier function.

**Private inputs** must be provided to the **prover function** when it runs in a user’s web browser. Because this data is provided by the user and remains local on their computer, this remains fully private. It will never exist on chain.

**Public inputs** must be provided to both the **prover function** and the **verifier function** (i.e. the Mina network) when it is verifying a zero-knowledge proof.

By default, all inputs are private unless you add `@pub` before the parameter.

In the earlier example, the `expected` parameter is public because we marked it with `@pub`, whereas the first input `x` is private by default. Thus, if a user provides a result of `27` with their proof, they prove that they know the cube root of `3`.

##### Prover function

When the prover function runs, it executes your custom logic to generate a zero-knowledge proof. In the earlier example, `const x3 = x.mul(x).mul(x);` is our custom logic.

##### Assertions

When the verifier function runs on the Mina network, it will execute your smart contract’s assertions to determine if a proof is valid.

Common assertions you may use are:

```ts
x.assertEquals();
x.assertBoolean();
x.assertLt(); // less than
x.assertLte(); // less than or equal to
x.assertGt(); // greater than
x.assertGte(); // greater than or equal to
```

For a full list, see the <DocLink copy="SnarkyJS reference" url="/zkapps/snarkyjs-reference" />.

### Managing State

##### Updating on-chain state

The 8 fields of 32 bytes of arbitrary on-chain state can be accessed via `this.state[n]`, where n is 0-7.

To update the on-chain state of your smart contract, you must use the `.set` method that is defined for every state property. Here, we define a `update` method marked with the `@method` decorator to indicate that this method is callable on the instance of our smart contract. Inside the `update` method, the `num` state property is read into `currentState` by using the `.get` method. To update the `num` state property, the `.set` method is called with its input parameter specifying an add operation with a Field value of 2. Using the `.set` method is how the on-chain state is updated for the Add smart contract.

##### Updating off-chain state

<Alert kind="info">

Off-chain state is not yet available.

</Alert>

### Testing your smart contract

Testing is critical when writing smart contracts.

The <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest testing framework</a> is included in all projects created by the Mina zkApp CLI via `zk project <name>`. We recommend Jest, but any testing framework can be used.

To run all test files within your project, run `npm run test` or `npm run testw` (for watch mode) from your project’s root directory.

To generate a test coverage report for your project, run `npm run coverage`. Coverage reports show the % of your code that is tested. The result will be output in your terminal. This can be helpful to ensure your code is well tested.

##### Learn more

Please see the <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started">Jest docs</a> for further information on how to use Jest.

We will be adding blockchain-specific testing functionality in the future. Keep an eye on this section for updates.

## Deployment

### Add a network alias to config.json

Before deploying, we must first define which network that we will deploy to and
give it a name. We do this by creating a network alias within your project's
`config.json`.

First, change into the directory containing your project and then run the
following command:

```sh
$ zk config
```

It will ask you to specify a name (can be anything), URL to deploy to, & fee (in
MINA) used when sending your deploy transaction. The URL is the Mina GraphQL API
that will receive your deploy transaction and broadcast it to the Mina network.
Note that this URL is important because it also determines which network you're
be deploying to (e.g. QANet, Testnet, Mainnet, etc).

For Berkeley QANet, let's use the following values:

- **Network Name**: `berkeley`
- **URL**: `https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql`
- **Fee**: `0.1`

<Alert kind="info">
  If your project contains multiple smart contracts (e.g. `Foo` and `Bar`) that
  you intend to deploy to the same network, we recommend following a naming
  pattern such as `berkeley-foo` and `berkeley-bar` for your network alias
  names.
</Alert>

You will see the following output:

```sh
$ zk config

Add a new network:
✔ Choose a name (can be anything): · berkeley
✔ Set URL to deploy to: · https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql
✔ Set transaction fee to use when deploying (in MINA): · 0.1
✔ Create key pair at keys/berkeley.json
✔ Add network to config.json

Success!

Next steps:

- If this is a testnet, request tMINA at:
  https://faucet.minaprotocol.com/qanets?address=<YOUR-ADDRESS>
- To deploy, run: `zk deploy berkeley`
```

### Request funds from the faucet

To deploy your zkApp, you will need some funds to pay for transaction fees.

To get funds on the Berkeley network, use the URL that was shown from the CLI output. Visit `https://faucet.minaprotocol.com/qanets?address=<YOUR-ADDRESS>` and click **Request**.

You will have to wait a few minutes for the next block to include your transaction, so you'll have tMINA before proceeding to the next step.

### Deploying your smart contract

To deploy your smart contract to the network, run the following command:

```sh
$ zk deploy berkeley
```

When running the deploy command, the zkApp CLI will compute a verification key for your zkApp CLI. Computing the verification key can take 1-2 minutes so please be patient. The zkApp CLI will show you the details of the transaction such as the network name, the URL, and the smart contract that will be deployed..

Finally, enter `yes` or `y` when prompted, to confirm and send the transaction.

You will see the following output:

```sh
$ zk deploy berkeley
✔ Build project
✔ Generate build.json
✔ Choose smart contract
  Only one smart contract exists in the project: Add
  Your config.json was updated to always use this
  smart contract when deploying to this network.
✔ Generate verification key (takes 1-2 min)
✔ Build transaction
✔ Confirm to send transaction
  Are you sure you want to send (yes/no)? · y
✔ Send to network

Success! Deploy transaction sent.

Next step:
  Your smart contract will be live (or updated)
  as soon as the transaction is included in a block:
  https://berkeley.minaexplorer.com/transaction/<txn-hash>
```

After a few minutes, the transaction will be included in the next block. To see your changes, search for the address that you used on [berkeley.minaexplorer.com](https://berkeley.minaexplorer.com).

## Writing a UI for your smart contract

To allow users to interact with your smart contract, you’ll typically want to build a website UI.

This UI can be written with any framework (e.g. React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) or plain HTML and JavaScript.

<Alert kind="info">

This is not yet production ready, but is work in progress.

</Alert>

### Adding your smart contract as a dependency of the UI

<Alert kind="info">

You can integrate your smart contract by publishing it to npm and adding it as a
dependency of your UI.

</Alert>

##### Publish to npm

1. **Create an npm account:** Create one <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/signup">here</a> if you don't have one yet.
2. **Login:** To sign in, enter `npm login` on the command line. You will be prompted to enter your username, password, and email address.
3. **Publish:** To publish your package, enter `npm publish` on the command line at the root of your smart contract project directory. If the package name already exists on npm, you will get an error. You can change the package name by changing the name property in your `package.json`.

<Alert kind="tip">

You can check if a package name already exists on npm using the <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-search">npm search</a>
terminal command. To avoid naming collisions, npm allows to publish scoped packages:
`@your-username/your-package-name`. For additional details about publishing packages including scoped packages, see the full npm <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/introduction-to-packages-and-modules">reference docs</a>.

</Alert>

##### Consuming your smart contract in your UI

Once you have published your smart contract to npm, you can easily add it to any UI framework of your choosing by importing the package.

1. **Install your smart contract package:** To install your package, run the following npm command: `npm install your-package-name` from the root of your UI project directory. Or if you published a scoped npm package, run `npm install @your-username/your-project-name`.
2. **Import your smart contract package into the UI using:** `import { YourSmartContract } from ‘your-smart-contract’;` , where `YourSmartContract` is the named export that you chose in your smart contract.

<Alert kind="tip">

For a more performant UI, you may want to render your UI before importing and loading your smart contract. This allows the SnarkyJS wasm workers to perform initialization without blocking the UI.

For example, if your UI is built using React, loading the smart contract in a `useEffect`,
instead of a top level import, will give the UI time to render its components before
loading SnarkyJS.

</Alert>

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  async function loadSmartContract() {
    const { YourSmartContract } = await import("your-smart-contract");
  }
  loadSmartContract();
}, []);
```
