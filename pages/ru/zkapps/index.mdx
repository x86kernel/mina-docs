### What are zkApps ?

zkApps (“zero-knowledge apps”) are Mina’s **zk-SNARK**-powered smart contracts.

zkApps use an **off-chain execution** and mostly **off-chain state** model. This allows for private computation and state that can be either private or public.

Using zk-SNARKs, zkApps can perform arbitrarily complex computations off chain while incurring only a flat fee to send the resulting zero-knowledge proof to the chain, as opposed to other blockchains which use a gas-fee based model.

You can learn more on the <DocLink copy="how zkApps work" url="/zkapps/how-zkapps-work" /> page.

### TypeScript

zkApps are written in TypeScript.

TypeScript provides an easy, familiar language (JavaScript), but with added type safety, making it easy to get started writing zkApps .

You can learn more on the How to write a zkApp (_coming soon_) page.

### Examples of zkApps

Play around with a few example zkApps to see what’s possible:
